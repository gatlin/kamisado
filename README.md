0. How to play
---

Two players each have 8 pieces across the board from one another. The object of
the game is to get one of your pieces to the other side.

Black player goes first. On the first move the player must select a piece to be
*active*. Only active pieces may be moved. Active pieces have dots in the
middle of them.

On each turn a player must select a tile for their active piece to move to. A
piece may only go directly forward or diagonally forward. A piece may be moved
any distance but it may not land on or skip over another piece.

The game will not let you make an illegal move.

The color of the tile you move your piece to becomes the color of your
opponent's active piece.

When a player wins the board resets and starts a new game.

It's pretty simple right now. Suggestions are always welcome!

  - Allow the board to be oriented the other way
  - Allow players to start with whichever color they choose
  - Two-player remote playing
