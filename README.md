Kamisado!

2016, Gatlin Johnson.

I did not come up with the game kamisado, just this online version of it.

0. How to play

You are the black player, the AI is the white player.

The object of the game is to get one of your pieces to the other side of the
board.

You start by selecting one of the black pieces and then where it should
go. A piece may be moved **forward** or **diagonally** (one tile up, one tile to
the side). You may move any distance you like but you may not go around another
piece. (Don't worry, the game won't let you pick wrong).

Now for the fun part: *the color of the tile you land on determines which piece
your opponent moves* (and vice versa).

Right now, when you win the board automatically resets.

2. Notes / plans

It's pretty simple right now. I want to have more happen when either player
wins. Also multiplayer would be sweet.

3. Questions / comments / bugs?
