0. How to play
---

Two players each have 8 pieces across the board from one another. The object of
the game is to get one of your pieces to the other side.

On the first turn, the black player selects a piece to move (it is "active").
The player may move their piece any number of tiles forward, or diagonally
forward, until they reach the edge of the board or another piece.

The game will not let you make an illegal move.

The color of the tile you move your piece to dictates your opponent's active
piece on the next round; you will see it now has a dot in the middle of it.

When a player wins the board resets and starts a new game.

2. Notes / plans

It's pretty simple right now. Suggestions are always welcome!

  - Allow the board to be oriented the other way
  - Allow players to start with whichever color they choose
  - Two-player remote playing
