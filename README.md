0. How to play
---

Two players each have 8 pieces across the board from one another. The object of
the game is to get one of your pieces to the other side.

Players move by selecting a tile for their currently selected piece to move to.
The color of the destination tile dictates the color piece that the opponent
may move.

Moves are only allowed if they are straight forward or diagonal. Pieces may
move until they hit another piece, the edge of the board, or the other side.

The game doesn't tell you if you've won (yet).

1. First move
---

On the first move no piecese are selected. Black goes first and clicks a piece
to select it. Gameplay then proceeds like above.

2. Credits
---

I didn't invent this game; [these people did][kamisadogame].
